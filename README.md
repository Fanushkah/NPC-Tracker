I'm making this to track my largely unimportant NPCs in my DND game I'm making. The plan is to make every portion of the NPC searchable to allow for quick searching during a game, allowing you to pull the NPC up as soon as they might
potentially be necessary. Such as when the party enters a specific city, church, or tavern. Hopefully tags will make this so that anyone can find this tool useful.
