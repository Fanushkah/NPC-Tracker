I'm making this to track my largely unimportant NPCs in my DND game I'm making. The plan is to make every portion of the NPC searchable to allow for quick searching during a game, allowing you to pull the NPC up as soon as they might
potentially be necessary. Such as when the party enters a specific city, church, or tavern. Hopefully tags will make this so that anyone can find this tool useful.


I threw together a .bat file to run it in 5 minutes. It may or may not work, I haven't tested it.

The script builds itself an "NPCs" folder if it can't find one. This lets me test my NPC stuff and work on this into the future without worrying about committing my NPCs folder or messing anyone else's up.
The safest way to update this script is to just download the Main.py file and replace the old one.
